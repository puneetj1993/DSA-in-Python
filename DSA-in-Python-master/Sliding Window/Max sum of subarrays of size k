Problem: Maximum Sum of sub-arrays of 'k' size( A sliding window problem)
Input:
    - An array arr of size n
    - Size of subwindow =3
Output:
    - Max Sum of all possible sub-arrays

    # Once, sub array of required k size is acheivied
    # add the jth element to sum and assign this sum to Max only if sum > max
    # Now, to maintain this window, we just have to increment j and i by 1
    # and to sum, we have to add arr[j] and minus arr[i-1] until the end of array
